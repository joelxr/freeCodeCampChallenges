## Running

### Development mode

All you have to do is `npm run dev` to execute a local script called `create-index.js` resposible to generate an `index.html` with links to all challenges located in `src` directory, after this [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is called to bundle all together and delivery it.

### Build and deploy

TBD.
